<div style="padding:10px; width:600px;">
	<span class="g_text14px">A) Do I want to own this company?</span><br />
	<div style="padding-left:20px;">
		1) What do they do?<br />
		2) Do they have a strong competitive advantage.<br />
		3) Check their income statements.  Are they growing their income over time?<br />
		4) Check their balance sheet.  Does it balance?  Is the equity growing at a good rate?<br />
		5) Check their cash flow.<br />
		6) Any debt?  What are they doing with it? I like a debt/equity ratio less than .5.<br />
		7) Read their 10Ks.<br />
		8) Insider ownership.  Companies that are run by people that have a high stake in the
		company tend to be run much more carefully.<br />
		9) Another good thing to check is their profit margins.  It is a good sign when these are 
		inching up over time or if they are greater than other companies in the same industry.<br />
		10) Do they have a dividend.  This is not necessary, but even a small dividend works
		toward keeping a company honest.  It is hard to sustain accounting lies when you keep
		actually kicking money out.  Also it is hard to complain about money landing in your pocket.
		Check the dividends payout ratio.  If they are paying out too much of their earnings
		then they will likely not be able to sustain their dividend.<br />
		11) Are there any significant concerns mentioned by analysts or others?

	<span class="g_text14px">B) Is the price reasonable?</span><br />
	<div style="padding-left:20px;">
		1) Check the Graham number.<br />
		2) Check their P/E. A PE less than or about 15 is reasonable for most industries.<br />
		3) Check their PEG. Around 1 or less is reasonable.<br />
		4) Check their P/B.  Above 8 to 10 can be a concern.  Less than 1 is always interesting because it 
		suggests that the company is selling for less than its equity.<br />
		5) Check their P/FCF.  15 or less is a good price.<br />
		6) Also check where it is relative to their PE history.<br />
		7) Check their FCF history.<br />
