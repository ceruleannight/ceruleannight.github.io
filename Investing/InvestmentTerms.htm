<div style="padding:10px; width:600px;">
	<b>Assets</b><br />
	Anything that a company owns that holds quantifiable monetary value.<br />
	<br />

	<b>Liabilities</b><br />
	All debts and legal obligations of a company that must be paid over time.<br />
	<br />

	<b>Equity</b><br />
	There are various definitions depending on the exact context, but at a basic level
	Equity can be defined as Assets minus Liabilities.<br />
	See:
	<a href="http://www.investopedia.com/terms/e/equity.asp" target="_blank" class="g_link12px">Equity</a><br />
	<br />

	<b>Book Value</b><br />
	Book Value as a concept is very closely related to Equity.
	Basically it is the amount that would be paid to share holders if a company were immediately liquidated.
	That is if the assets were sold for value and all liabilities paid off and the rest distributed
	to the shareholders.<br />
	See:
	<a href="http://www.investopedia.com/terms/b/bookvalue.asp" target="_blank" class="g_link12px">Book Value</a><br />
	<br />

	<b>EV: Enterprise Value</b><br />
	This is effectively the cost of taking over a company.
	It is basically the market cap plus debts minus cash.
	Some people prefer to use this value in place of market cap or price in various metrics
	as it better reflects the impact to your equity by owning a company.<br />

	<br />

	<b>P/E or PE</b><br />
	Price divided by Earnings.
	This is used when evaluating whether or not a company is at a fair price.
	There are several PE types.  Usually PE refers 
	to the current stock price divided by the earnings for the trailing twelve months.
	This is sometimes qualified as PE TTM, or Trailing PE.
	Forward PE refers to the current price divided by analyst projected earning,
	usually for the next twelve months.
	For many industries a PE of 15 is considered a fair price.<br />
	Cyclically-adjusted P/E or CAPE or PE10 or Shiller PE refer to an alternate way of 
	assessing PE that divides the current price by an average the earnings adjusted 
	for inflation over a ten year period.  Some feel that this give a better relative
	picture of valuation.<br />
	<br />

	<b>PEG</b><br />
	P/E divided by analyst projected annual growth as a percent.
	This is used when evaluating whether or not a company is at a fair price.
	This is considered a better metric to use than PE by some because it factors in
	projected future growth of the company.  A generally accepted rule of thumb is that a PEG
	of one or less is a sign of fair value and a value greater one is considered overpriced.<br />
	<br />

	<b>EBITDA</b><br />
	<br />

	<b>TTM</b> - Trailing Twelve Months<br />
	<b>MRQ</b> - Most Recent Quarter<br />
	<br />

	<b>YOY</b><br />
	Year over year.
	Prospective investors usually evaluate a company's quarterly earnings relative
	to the same quarter from the year earlier.  This is called year-over-year comparison.
	This is done because so many industries and companies have earnings that are cyclical
	on an annual basis.<br />
	<br />

	<b>10K</b><br />
	A company's annual report that they must file with the SEC.<br />
	<br />

	<b>Margin of Safety</b><br />
	<br />
