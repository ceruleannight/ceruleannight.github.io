	Stock search idea: Search for companies with very high P/E ratios to discover companies
	or ideas that may be part of powerful up and coming trends.  Such companies may be a great
	buy even with high PEs depending on how they are using their income.  If a company
	is pouring all their money back into the company to scale out their business
	this might be a good thing, though it will cause them to have a high PE.<br />
	<br />

	Google this: "[ company name or ticker ] competitive advantage."<br />
	<br />

	Google this: "[ company name or ticker ] SWOT analysis" (Strengths, Weaknesses, Opportunities and Threats)<br />
	<br />

	When a new disruptive technologies starts to emerge try to discover who makes the components
	and consider the possibility of investing in these companies.<br />
	In January of 2013 it was discovered that Google Glass contained a Himax mini projector for
	the display.  Himax shares doubled over the next five months after the discovery.
	Cirrus Logic chips in the iPhone has propelled that company to many times what it was when
	the iPhone was introduced.<br />
	<br />

	Search for strong companies that have taken a tumble for some reason.  This has the possibility
	to be a great opportunity to get in.  Use a screener such as that from FinViz with something like
	the following filters:<br />
	&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sales growth past 5 years > 20%<br />
	&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;EPS growth past 5 years > 20%<br />
	&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Gross margin > 30%<br />
	&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Net profit margin > 10%<br />
	&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;LT Debt/Equity < 1<br />
	&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;30% (or more) below 52 week high<br />
	<br />

	Screen for stocks that are at a high level above their 52 week lows such as 200% or more.
	For some of these there are probably some really good valid reasons that people are piling in,
	and for some there is probably a lot more increase to come.
	It has not been uncommon recently to find companies that have increased several hundred percent within
	a 12 month period.<br />
	Then apply other qualifiers to vet out qualities.
	From here drill into some to discover their value.<br />
