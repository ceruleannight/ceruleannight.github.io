	"It’s far better to buy a wonderful company at a fair price than a fair company at a wonderful price."
	&nbsp;- Warren Buffet<br />

	"Buy commodities, sell brands." - Warren Buffet<br />
	The idea here is that it is a great business to be in when you can buy off-the-shelf commodities,
	process them into well recognized brands and then sell them for significantly more than what
	it cost for the goods and processing.<br />

	In the short run the market is a voting machine.  In the long run it is a weighing machine.<br />
	&nbsp;- Benjamin Graham<br />
	<br /><div class="g_hline" /><br />

	Investor Ralph Wagoner once explained how markets work, recalled by Bill Bernstein: 
	"He likens the market to an excitable dog on a very long leash in New York City, darting 
	randomly in every direction. The dog's owner is walking from Columbus Circle, through 
	Central Park, to the Metropolitan Museum. At any one moment, there is no predicting which 
	way the pooch will lurch. But in the long run, you know he's heading northeast at an average 
	speed of three miles per hour. What is astonishing is that almost all of the market players, 
	big and small, seem to have their eye on the dog, and not the owner."<br />
	<br /><div class="g_hline" /><br />

	Buffet on a simple test for stock selection<br />
	"When Charlie and I buy stocks -- which we think of as small portions of businesses -- our 
	analysis is very similar to that which we use in buying entire businesses. We first have to
	decide whether we can sensibly estimate an earnings range for five years out, or more. If 
	the answer is yes, we will buy the stock (or business) if it sells at a reasonable price in
	relation to the bottom boundary of our estimate. If, however, we lack the ability to 
	estimate future earnings -- which is usually the case -- we simply move on to other prospects."<br />

	<b>Carl Richards – 2013/3/6</b><br />
	If you take the daily returns of the Dow from 1900 to 2008 and you subtract the 10 best days, you end 
	up with about 60% less money than if you had stayed invested the entire time. I know that story has 
	been told by the buy-and-hold crowd for years, but what you don't hear very often is what happens if 
	you were to miss the worst 10 days. Keep in mind that we are talking about 10 days out of 29,694. If 
	you remove the worst 10 days from history, you would have ended up with three times more money.<br />
	<br />

	<b>Buck Hartzell – 2005/10/26</b><br />
	If a home is selling for 150 times the monthly rent (or less), it's generally a good deal. If it's selling 
	for more than 200 times the monthly rent of a comparable property, you're better off renting. I ran this 
	little test for a house near Fool HQ in Alexandria, Va. House A has five bedrooms and 4.5 baths, and it 
	sits on one pristine acre. You can rent House A for $3,900 per month. Based on comparable sales, this 
	home would sell for approximately $2 million. Therefore, it's selling for 512 times the monthly rent! 
	Put another way, if you mortgaged the whole $2 million at 5.42% over 30 years, your monthly payment 
	would be more than $11,000.<br />

	<b>Trading vs. Investing</b><br />
	Trading is the idea of buying and selling stocks to make money usually with a relatively
	short holding period expectation. Investing has a much longer expected holding period 
	including the Buffet ideal of indefinitely.<br />

	"The conservative banker is an impressive specimen, diffusing the healthy glow which comes of moderation 
	in eating, living, and thinking. He sits in state and spends his days saying, with varying inflections
	and varying contexts, 'no.' ... He says 'yes' only a few times a year. His rule is that he reserves his 
	yesses for organizations so wealthy that if he said 'no,' some other banker would quickly say 'yes.' His
	business might be defined as the lending of money exclusively to people who have no pressing need of it."<br />

	<b>Morgan Housel - Motley Fool 2012</b><br />
	Two centuries of data makes one point clear: Over the long haul, stocks trounce the returns of bonds, 
	cash, commodities, and real estate -- and they do it with less risk. Adjusted for inflation, $1 invested 
	in stocks in 1802 was worth $755,000 in 2006. In bonds, $1 turned into $1,083. Gold grew to $1.95. 
	Cash depreciated to $0.06. During that 200-year stretch, the worst 20-year period for stocks produced 
	a real return of 1% a year. For bonds, the worst period eroded half of investors' purchasing power. 
	Stocks win over the long haul, and yet a large number of Americans avoid them.<br />

	<b>Vincent Fernando on the Baltic Dry Index</b><br />
	To start he noted:<br />
	<div style="padding-left:10px;">
		Why do shipping rates seem to jump all over the place? Due to near-term supply of ships versus demand 
		for commodities. It's just a matter of bottleneck problems. If rates go up it can come from either of 
		two things: not enough ships at the time or too much commodities demand at the time. In a situation 
		where ship owners match demand, which over the long run they will, then rates won't skyrocket and 
		will just track their costs plus some margin for their effort.<br />
	</div>
	<br />
	He then offered up this very obvious example to explain the volatility...<br />
	<div style="padding-left:10px;">
		Imagine you have 10 loads of iron ore and 9 ships, and that every load of iron ore must be sent no matter 
		what while every ship must be filled no matter what. Imagine the bidding war between those 10 iron ore 
		consumers fighting over just 9 ships. Shipping costs would skyrocket since they all need to ship regardless 
		of cost. Now imagine if a week later two more ships enter the market. Now imagine the bidding process. 
		Suddenly the tables have completely changed. You have 11 ships, that all need to be filled no matter what, 
		and only 10 loads of ore. Shipping rates would plunge, despite a period of just a week passing by. This 
		is, in a simplified nutshell why the BDI is so volatile.<br />
	</div>
	<br />
	And he concluded...<br />
	<div style="padding-left:10px;">
		Now, add to this the fact that predicting ship supply and commodities demand has a pretty high margin of 
		error, at the same time remembering how sensitive the BDI is to small mismatches due to the inelastic 
		nature of its underlying supply and demand, and you quickly realize that predicting the BDI is a fool's 
		game and also that it is not a reliable forward indicator given that it is a spot rate index in a market 
		where both sides are basically forced to close a deal due to high fixed costs. The BDI is a measure of 
		supply/demand mismatch at the moment, and can change drastically on a dime. It's little else beyond this. 
		It hit its peak not when the global economy was in its healthiest state, but in early 2008 when things were 
		already starting to come apart, but Chinese commodities demand growth still had some steam and just kept 
		outstripping stagnant vessel supply growth. For a moment. And then it all collapsed.<br />

	<b>Upside &amp; Downside Investing Potential</b><br />
	When you invest $100 in a stock you have the potential to lose a maximum of $100.  This is your downside potential.
	On the other hand, however, depending on the investment the stock price could go up many times over.  This is 
	the upside potential.  A well-chosen stock purchase can have upside potential that far outweighs the downside.<br />
