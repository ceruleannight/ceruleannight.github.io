	Mountain Man is a game concept I have had for probably over 15 years.
	It is inspired somewhat from The Oregon Trail.
	This is actually the third try at writing the game.
	On the first attempt I was in Venezuela over Christmas in 2003
	trying to program on a foreign keyboard with many keys in weird places.
	I didn't get very far.
	Then in 2014 I took another attempt.  By this point with three kids and
	many other responsibilities I found that I was biting off more than I wanted to get into
	at that point and eventually I abandoned the project.
	Then in the summer of 2016 while needing a break from some other stuff
	I decided to scale back my ambitions for the game and frame up something
	much simpler but complete-able for me.
	This is the result. Enjoy. -- Pat Colllins<br />
