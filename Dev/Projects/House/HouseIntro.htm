	Part of my original interest in programming was sparked by text adventure games.
	The first text adventure that I attempted was this game, House.  In fact, Dave and I used to play
	this exact game over the phone where he would issue commands I would simulate the computer's response.
	That was around 1986.  At that time I was not capable enough in programming to write the game and 
	I never did write it until in 2010 I was thinking about that game and decided to write it in 
	JavaScript.  The resulting game is very close to the original plan with a few things added to 
	fill it out a bit.<br />
	<br />
	In house you type simple commands like North, South, Look, Take, Open etc. and the game responds to your input.
	Give it a try and see what you think.<br />
